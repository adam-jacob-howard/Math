To determine the existence of a regular homotopy between two immersions, $f, g: M \rightarrow N$, is equivalent to showing that they lie in the same path component of the space ${\sf Imm}(M, N).$ We identify the connected components, $\pi_{0}{\sf Imm}(W_{g}, M),$ of the space of immersions from a closed, orientable, genus-$g$ surface $W_{g}$ into a parallelizable manifold $M$. We also identify the higher homotopy groups of ${\sf Imm}(W_{g}, M)$ in terms of the homotopy groups of $M$ and the Stiefel space $\sV_{2}(n)$. We then use this work to characterize immersions from tori into hyperbolic manifolds as self covers of a tubular neighborhood of a closed geodesic up to regular homotopy. Finally, we identify the homotopy-type of the space of framed immersions from the torus to itself.
